# ASP.NET-Core_API_with_Angular_CRUD
This sample ASP.NET Core 6.0 Web API and Angular (v15.2) with Typescript projects demonstrate a basic implementation of CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) Operations.

The webapi serves as the backend web api or the RESTful Service that handles different requests like get,post,put & delete methods. While the project angular serves as the frontend that consumes the requests from our web api project.

Additionally, I added a signalr feature in this project. So, every time there's a new changes or update made by the server, it will automatically trigger the angular list of data and refresh it. To learn more about
